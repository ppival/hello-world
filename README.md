# hello-world
This is a test repository for the Software Carpentry workshop

Not sure yet what's going to go here, or whether I can connect this to both the Github desktop client **and** [GitKraken](http://www.gitkraken.com/)

###Backwards-incompatible changes:

When using the –columns or –not-columns options, you must not have spaces around the comma-separated values, unless the column names contain spaces.
CSVKitReader, CSVKitWriter, and CSVKitDictReader have been removed. Use agate.reader, agate.writer, agate.DictReader and agate.DictWriter.
